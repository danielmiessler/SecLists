Laudanum is a collection of injectable files, designed to be used in a pentest
when upload vulnerabilities, administrative interfaces, and SQL injection flaws 
are found. These files are written in multiple languages for different 
environments. They provide functionality such as shell, DNS query, LDAP 
retrieval and others.
