This wordlist was collected by parsing Alexa top-million sites for **[.DS_Store](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.DS_Store)** files, extracting all the found files, and then extracting found file and directory names from around 300k real websites. The files were then sorted by probability and one-occurrence strings were removed.
