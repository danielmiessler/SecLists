## `names-brazil-top100000.txt`
This list was created from a dump of official names listed by IBGE (Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics), which is a government agency in Brazil responsible for collecting statistical and population data.

The official IBGE website was used, which occasionally ranks the most popular names by state, age, and year, and this allowed the creation of a large and reliable dump of Brazilian names.
